Project 04 - 35 Points
======================

**Date Assigned:** *TBD*

**Due Date:** Friday, May 3, 2024, 5 pm CST.

**Group Assignment:** Students can work individually or in groups of two on this assignment. 
When working in groups, we expect both students to contribute equally to all aspects of the 
project. You are allowed to talk to students in other groups about the project, but 
please do not copy any code for the notebook or text for the report.

If you use ChatGPT, please state exactly how you used it. For example, state which parts of the 
code it helped you generate, which errors it helped you debug, etc. Please do not use ChatGPT to 
generate the report for part 3. 

**Late Policy:**  This project is due during the final exam period for our class. As a result, 
we will not be able to accept late projects. 


**Project Description:** Open-ended ML

The last project is open-ended, allowing you to propose an idea for a project that is of 
interest to you. You may build upon any of the previous projects, and you may incorporate any of the 
techniques or ideas presented in the lectures. You may also choose to study and incorporate a 
published paper or a new ML technology.

Initial Proposal 
----------------
Begin by writing an initial proposal for your project. The initial proposal has a maximum of 2 pages in length, 
though you can include additional figures and/or data samples, etc., beyond the two pages, as necessary.

Include the following in your proposal: 
 
 1) Introduction and project statement -- A short introduction and summary of the project
 2) Data sources that will be used -- A reference to any datasets utilized in the project 
 3) Methods that will be used, including new techniques or technology
 4) Products to be delivered -- what are the primary deliverables for the project? This is what we will be 
    grading

 
Final Report and Video
-----------------------
Submit a written report of your project. The following sections should be covered:

1. Introduction and project statement 
2. Data sources and technologies used 
3. Methods employed
4. Results 
5. References 

The final report should be a maximum of 10 pages. 

Also, create a short video, **no more than 10 minutes**. The video should be a presentation 
of your report and cover the primary aspects of your work. We will watch all of the videos 
during the final exam week. 
(Attendance will be optional).

Grading 
-------
The final project will be graded as follows:

Project Concept -- 14 points (40%)
 1. Does the project concept involve relevant machine learning topics, ideas and/or technologies? 
 2. Is the project useful and/or interesting? 
 3. (Bonus points) Is the project unique?

Project Products -- 13 points (30%)
 1. Do the products achieve the described goals? 
 2. Are the products available (e.g., in a code repository)?
 3. Are the products well-documented? 

Final Report & Video -- 13 points (30%)
 1. Does the the final report cover all sections?
 2. Is the writing easy to follow? (i.e., there is a logical progression of , important details are not missing but we are not drowned in minutiae either, etc.)
 3. Are all sources referenced? 

Project Ideas 
-------------
1. Find a new dataset of interest to you and build an ML model for it using any number of techniques we have 
   looked at in class. Make a hypothesis about which model or architecture will be optimal, and evaluate the 
   different models you build. 
2. Investigate advanced classical algorithms such as XGBoost or Support Vector Machines for tabular data. 
   How do these methods compare to those we studied in Unit 2? 
3. ML Testing -- design and develop a test suite for an ML model you have 
4. Investigate methods for utilizing transformer models/LLMs for structured/tabular data. How does few-shot
   or even zero-short learning perform on structured datasets we have looked at? Compare the results to 
   methods we looked at in class. 
5. Explore a search space of neural network architectures to find the optimal architecture or explore other 
   hyperparameters. What search technique will you use? Consider investigating 
   the `Keras Tuner <https://keras.io/keras_tuner/>`_ package to 
   explore hyperparameters associated with a Keras model. The package includes different search strategies you 
   can try. 
6. Truthfulness of LLMs -- Run the TruthfulQA benchmark on a number of LLMs from Hugging Face and report the results. 
7. LLM fine-tuning -- Fine tune a language model on a specific task of interest to you. Think about a problem 
   that will allow you to build a data set that can be used for fine-tuning. Evaluate the model 
   on the task both before and after fine-tuning. Also, evaluate the model on a different task, both before 
   and after the fine-tuning. Does the fine-tuning process cause the model to "forget" (i.e., get worse at)
   the task it was not fine-tuned on?
