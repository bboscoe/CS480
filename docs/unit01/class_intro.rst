From the Syllabus 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Catalog Description:**

Covers design, implementation, operation and assurance of intelligent software systems based on data intensive 
computing and machine learning techniques. Course materials and assignments will 
utilize real-world datasets from engineering disciplines.

**Prerequisites:**

Flexible, if you are upper level and have taken either Intro to Data Science or AI Engineering.


**Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities Students Should Have Before Entering This Course:**

This course assumes knowledge of the Python programming language (data structures, conditionals, 
loops, and functions), software design, distributed systems, and asynchronous programming (concurrent 
programming, task queues, microservice architectures, etc). We also assume knowledge of Multivariate 
Calculus and Linear Algebra as well as a basic, working knowledge of the Linux command line. We 
will not introduce/cover basic programming skills or debugging. Ultimately, each student is expected 
to be able to write and debug working Python programs and to have experience designing larger systems 
as a composition of smaller components. This is not an introductory programming class nor an introductory 
design class; we will not have time to help students debug their programs.


**Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities Students Gain from this Course (Learning Outcomes):**

The objective of this course is to introduce students to scalable data analysis and machine learning 
techniques for designing, implementing, validating and operating responsible intelligent systems. 
The course covers algorithms, techniques and tools for applying data analytics and machine 
learning to real-world problems. Through a series of projects spanning the course of the semester, 
students design and implement responsible, intelligent computational systems. The course strikes 
a balance between foundational and state-of-the-art techniques.


**Class Format**

The class will be delivered in-person. Class 
meetings will consist of lectures/demonstrations and hands-on labs. Students are expected to attend 
every lecture and actively participate in the hands-on labs during the class. In some cases, 
the hands-on portions will provide partial solutions to project assignments. 
Additionally, there will be a class Slack channel for discussing ideas about the course with 
your fellow students.

**Attendance**

Regular attendance is expected but absences will not count against the studentâ€™s grade. We expect 
students to give us a week's notice in advance of their absence if known ahead of time.

**Computer:**

The entire course will be computer based. The instructor will provide remote servers for students to 
work on. Students are expected to have access to a 
personal / lab computer with a web browser and a terminal and SSH/SCP client.
**You will be given a VM with GPU, at no cost.**

**Text:**
No textbook will be used for this course. However, we will provide materials for all lectures on the 
class website, and we will often supplement them with additional reading materials available online. 


**Office Hours:**

Office hours will be for 1 hour immediately following the class and/or by appointment. We plan to 
use Slack for general communications and to help with the materials. 


We will provide more details about each of the projects as the assignment date approaches. 


CS 480
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We cover software system design concepts for systems that can perform non-trivial data analysis, 
but we barely scratch the surface of the subject of data analysis itself. 

In this course, we are going to cover techniques and technologies for building applications utilizing 
data analysis and machine learning, specifically.  

We will focus more on applications of machine learning, applying the techniques to real datasets, and less 
on the theoretical basis for the algorithms. However, we 
will introduce the ideas involved with most of the algorithms we cover, so that you can get a feel 
for the flavor. 

We will emphasize applications written in the Python programming language. We will make use 
of a number of open source libraries, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikitlearn, Pytorch 
and keras. 

We'll assume you know:

* Python programming and best practices with respect to code organization within a repo. 
* How to commit and work with code in a git repository. 
* How to install a package; how to build a Docker image with a package installed. 
* How to read the documentation for a package and use it in your code. 
* The basics of HTTP, Docker, flask (for building web APIs) 

What is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning?
-----------------------------------------------------

Some people consider the birth of the term "artificial intelligence" to be a summer workshop
held at Dartmouth college in 1956, the "Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence". 
Others say the origins date back to as early as 1940, with efforts at places such as MIT and CMU. 

Many definitions have been given; for example, the proposal for the 1956 Dartmouth Workshop states: 

   *The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other 
   feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.*


If we look back even just a couple of decades, we see that the field of Artifical Intelligence had already 
grown into a huge field and encompassed techniques from logic, probability, perception, reasoning, and learning.


Many consider Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russell of UC Berkeley and Peter Norvig,
Director of Research at Google, to be the definitive book on AI. It's topics include: 

* Search Algorithms 
* Intelligent Agents 
* Logical Agents and First Order Logic, 
* Knowledge Representation (ontologies)
* Automated Planning 
* Uncertainty, Probabilistic Reasoning, and Probabilistic Programming
* Multi-agent Decision Making 
* **Machine Learning**
* **Deep Learning**
* Robotics

Recent as the last decade or so Machine Learning and Deep Learning as subfields within AI have taken off.
Some say ML is the dominant subfield of AI.


What is Machine Learning?
-------------------------

Machine Learning (ML) is the subfield of AI that develops algorithms to analyze and infer patterns in *data*.

Here, **data** is the key word. Instead of using logic, or a search technique, or a formal knowledge
representation, ML looks for patterns in exsiting data sets and attempts to apply those patterns to 
future data. 

Why is Machine Learning having so much success *now*? Two primary reasons: 

1. There is an abundance of data, thanks to the internet, automation and IoT devices. 
2. Computing power has continued to increase so that algorithms that were not tractable a decade ago 
   can now complete in a relatively short amount of time. 


And as a result, we are seeing applications of ML to virtually all fields. In this class we will explore 
datasets and applications from fields including: 

* Computational Biology and health informatics (e.g., predicting diabetes)
* Structural/Civil Engineering (e.g., classifying damage to buildings)
* Traditional IT (e.g., spam email classification)

And many more. 

With Power Comes Responsibility 
-------------------------------

While this is undeniably an exciting time for the field, the power to create models that accurately 
predict outcomes in various fields comes with significant responsibilities. In this class, we will 
try to highlight some of the important aspects of these responsibilities. We will ask questions such as 

1. How do use data in a responsible way? Do we just throw a bunch of ML algorithms at the data 
   and see what gives us the result we are looking for?
2. As we train our models, how do we ensure our results are reproducible? 
3. How do we build trust in our models? How do we develop confidence in our models? Is accuracy the only important 
   measure (hint: no)
4. How do you update an existing model once you a version is running? 
5. What about bias in models? If models reflect patterns in data, and data have bias, won't our models 
   have bias too? 


We'll look at many of these topics throughout the semester.

Student Responses: Goals for the Course 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We got some great responses from you all about your goals for the course. Here are a few 
quotes: 

*"I would love to get a deeper understanding on how machine learning can automate a lot of the 
tedious tasks seen in our daily lives. Additionally, my work this past summer has let me 
get a baseline for how to make a machine learning and classification model, so having a 
formal education and introduction to this field would be really helpful!"*

*"...what's most important to me is to learn something new, challenge myself, 
and maybe become a better person because of it."*

*"I always hear the word machine learning tossed around, 
but I want to know more about what it really is and what its applications are."*

Here is a word cloud of the responses (using term frequencies, a concept we will learn 
more about in the context of NLP!)
